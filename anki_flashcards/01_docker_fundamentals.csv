Front,Back
"What is Docker and what problem does it solve?","Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. It solves the ""it works on my machine"" problem by ensuring consistent environments across development, staging, and production."
"What are the main differences between Docker containers and Virtual Machines?","Containers share the host OS kernel and are lightweight (MB), while VMs include a full OS and are heavier (GB). Containers start faster, use fewer resources, but VMs provide stronger isolation."
"What is a Docker image?","A Docker image is a read-only template that contains the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies needed to run an application. It's used to create containers."
"What is a Docker container?","A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. It's an isolated, lightweight, and executable package that includes everything needed to run an application."
"What command installs Docker Desktop on macOS using Homebrew?","brew install --cask docker"
"How do you start Docker Desktop on macOS from the command line?","open -a Docker"
"What command checks if Docker is properly installed and running?","docker --version or docker ps"
"What is the difference between 'docker run' and 'docker exec'?","'docker run' creates and starts a new container from an image, while 'docker exec' runs a command in an already running container."
"What does the '-d' flag do in 'docker run -d'?","The '-d' flag runs the container in detached mode (in the background), so it doesn't block your terminal."
"What does the '-it' flags combination do in Docker commands?","'-i' keeps STDIN open (interactive), '-t' allocates a pseudo-TTY. Together they allow interactive terminal access to a container."
"What command shows all running Docker containers?","docker ps"
"What command shows all Docker containers (running and stopped)?","docker ps -a"
"What command removes a Docker container?","docker rm <container-name-or-id>"
"What command removes a Docker image?","docker rmi <image-name-or-id>"
"What's the difference between 'docker stop' and 'docker kill'?","'docker stop' sends SIGTERM signal for graceful shutdown, while 'docker kill' sends SIGKILL for immediate termination."
"What command pulls a Docker image from a registry?","docker pull <image-name:tag>"
"What is Docker Hub?","Docker Hub is the default public registry for Docker images, where you can find and share container images."
"What command shows Docker system information including version and status?","docker info"
"How do you view the logs of a Docker container?","docker logs <container-name-or-id>"
"What does 'docker system df' show?","Shows Docker disk usage including space used by images, containers, and volumes."
"What command cleans up unused Docker resources?","docker system prune"
"What is the purpose of a Dockerfile?","A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions to build a Docker image automatically. It defines the base image, dependencies, and configuration."
"What instruction in a Dockerfile specifies the base image?","FROM instruction, e.g., 'FROM ubuntu:22.04'"
"What Dockerfile instruction is used to run commands during image build?","RUN instruction, e.g., 'RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx'"
"What Dockerfile instruction copies files from host to container during build?","COPY instruction, e.g., 'COPY ./app /app'"
