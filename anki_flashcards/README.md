## üí° Study Tips

### Active Recall Techniques
- Don't just read the answer - try to explain concepts in your own words
- Connect related concepts across different card sets
- Apply knowledge by referencing your actual Docker project

### Spaced Repetition
- Review cards consistently, even when you think you know them
- Pay attention to cards you get wrong repeatedly
- Use Anki's built-in algorithm - don't skip review sessions

### Practical Application
- Reference these concepts while working with your Docker environment
- Try implementing concepts from flashcards in real scenarios
- Use the monitoring script and Docker commands from your project

## üèÜ Career Application

These flashcards prepare you for:
- **DevOps Engineer** interviews and daily work
- **Cloud Engineer** positions requiring containerization
- **System Administrator** roles with modern infrastructure
- **Docker/Kubernetes** certification exams
- **Enterprise IT** positions requiring security knowledge

## üìù Additional Notes

- All examples use the actual commands and configurations from your project
- Cards are based on enterprise-grade practices, not just basic Docker
- Security and best practices are emphasized throughout
- Content aligns with your AWS, Azure, CCNA, and Security+ certifications
