Front,Back
"What is RHEL UBI and why is it important for enterprise environments?","Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) is a freely redistributable base container image based on RHEL. It allows organizations to build and redistribute containerized applications without needing a Red Hat subscription."
"What are the main differences between Ubuntu LTS and regular Ubuntu releases?","Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support) versions are released every 2 years and supported for 5 years, providing stability for enterprise use. Regular releases are every 6 months with 9 months of support."
"Why might an organization still use CentOS 7 in 2024?","For legacy application support, compatibility testing during migration, or applications that specifically require CentOS 7 dependencies that haven't been ported to newer distributions."
"What is the significance of using non-root users in containers?","Non-root users reduce security risks by limiting privileges, following the principle of least privilege, and preventing potential container breakout attacks from gaining root access on the host."
"What does 'dnf' stand for and what distribution uses it?","DNF stands for 'Dandified YUM' and is the package manager used in Red Hat-based distributions like RHEL, CentOS 8+, and Fedora."
"What package manager does Ubuntu use and what are its main commands?","Ubuntu uses APT (Advanced Package Tool). Main commands: 'apt update' (refresh package list), 'apt install' (install packages), 'apt upgrade' (upgrade packages)."
"What is the difference between 'yum' and 'dnf'?","DNF is the successor to YUM with better dependency resolution, improved performance, and more consistent behavior. CentOS 8+ and RHEL 8+ use DNF."
"What does the '/etc/sudoers' file control?","The /etc/sudoers file controls which users can run which commands as other users (typically root) using the sudo command."
"What is the purpose of the 'appuser' we created in our containers?","The 'appuser' is a non-root user created for security best practices, allowing applications to run with limited privileges rather than as the root user."
"What does the command 'groupadd -r appuser' do?","Creates a system group named 'appuser' with the '-r' flag indicating it's a system group (typically with GID < 1000)."
"What does 'useradd -r -g appuser -m -s /bin/bash appuser' do?","Creates a system user 'appuser' (-r), adds it to group 'appuser' (-g), creates home directory (-m), and sets default shell to bash (-s /bin/bash)."
"Why do we run 'chown -R appuser:appuser /app /logs /config'?","To change ownership of directories to the appuser, ensuring the non-root user has proper permissions to read/write in application directories."
"What does 'chmod 750' permissions mean?","Owner has read/write/execute (7), group has read/execute (5), others have no permissions (0). This restricts access to owner and group only."
"What is the significance of cleaning package caches in Dockerfiles?","Cleaning caches (dnf clean all, apt-get clean) reduces image size by removing temporary files and package metadata that aren't needed in the final image."
"What does '&& \\' syntax do in Dockerfile RUN commands?","The '&&' chains commands (only run next if previous succeeds), and '\\' continues the command on the next line for better readability."
"What is the Red Hat Container Catalog?","registry.access.redhat.com is Red Hat's container registry providing officially supported and certified container images including UBI."
"What are the advantages of using official distribution images?","Official images are maintained by the distribution vendor, receive security updates, are well-documented, and follow best practices for containerization."
"What is the difference between RHEL and CentOS?","RHEL is a commercial enterprise Linux with paid support, while CentOS was a free rebuild of RHEL sources. CentOS Stream is now the upstream for RHEL."
"Why might you choose Ubuntu over RHEL for development environments?","Ubuntu often has newer software packages, larger community, extensive documentation, and many development tools are primarily tested on Ubuntu/Debian systems."
"What does 'DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive' do?","Prevents APT from prompting for user input during package installation, essential for automated Dockerfile builds."
"What is the purpose of setting timezone in containers?","Ensures consistent time handling across all containers and prevents issues with applications that depend on specific timezone settings."
"What does 'ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC /etc/localtime' do?","Creates a symbolic link to set the system timezone to UTC, with '-s' for symbolic link and '-f' to force overwrite if file exists."
"Why is UTC commonly used in enterprise systems?","UTC eliminates timezone confusion, simplifies log correlation across global systems, and avoids daylight saving time issues."
"What is the benefit of multi-distribution container environments?","Allows testing application compatibility across different Linux distributions, supports legacy applications, and provides flexibility for different use cases."
"What does 'procps-ng' package provide in RHEL containers?","Provides system monitoring tools like ps, top, free, vmstat, and other utilities for viewing running processes and system resources."
