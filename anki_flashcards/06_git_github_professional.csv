"What is the difference between 'git add .' and 'git add -A'?","'git add .' adds files in current directory and subdirectories, 'git add -A' adds all changes in the entire repository."
"What makes a good Git commit message?","Clear, concise description of what changed, follows conventional format (e.g., 'feat:', 'fix:', 'docs:'), includes context when needed."
"What is the conventional commit format?","type(scope): description, e.g., 'feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration' or 'fix(docker): resolve container startup issue'"
"What command initializes a new Git repository?","git init"
"How do you check the status of your Git working directory?","git status"
"What is the purpose of 'git remote add origin <url>'?","Adds a remote repository named 'origin' that you can push to and pull from."
"What does 'git push -u origin main' do?","Pushes the main branch to origin and sets up tracking so future 'git push' commands work without arguments."
"What is GitHub CLI and why is it useful?","Command-line tool (gh) for interacting with GitHub, allowing you to create repos, manage issues, and perform GitHub operations from terminal."
"How do you authenticate GitHub CLI?","gh auth login (then follow the prompts for web browser authentication)"
"What command creates a new GitHub repository using GitHub CLI?","gh repo create <repo-name> --public --description 'description' --push"
"What are GitHub repository topics and why are they important?","Keywords that help categorize and make repositories discoverable, improving visibility and helping others find relevant projects."
"What is the purpose of repository badges in README files?","Provide quick visual information about build status, version, license, technologies used, and other project metrics."
"Why is it important to have a professional GitHub profile?","Showcases your skills to employers, demonstrates coding practices, serves as a portfolio, and builds your professional reputation."
"What should a professional README include?","Clear description, installation instructions, usage examples, architecture diagrams, contributing guidelines, and contact information."
