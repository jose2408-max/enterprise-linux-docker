Front,Back
"What makes a Docker environment 'enterprise-ready'?","Security hardening, monitoring, logging, documentation, scalability, reproducible deployments, proper labeling, and compliance with industry standards."
"What is semantic versioning and why is it important?","Semantic versioning uses MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format (e.g., 1.2.3) to communicate the nature of changes, helping with dependency management and deployment decisions."
"What should be included in a professional README for a Docker project?","Architecture diagrams, quick start guide, container details, security implementation, monitoring setup, management commands, and troubleshooting information."
"What is the purpose of a CHANGELOG in software projects?","Documents all notable changes, new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes in a chronological format for users and developers."
"What are the benefits of using consistent labeling in Docker resources?","Enables automation, improves organization, facilitates monitoring, helps with resource management, and supports enterprise governance policies."
"What is the standard format for enterprise container labels?","Use reverse domain notation like 'com.company.environment=production' and include metadata like version, maintainer, and purpose."
"Why is documentation important in enterprise environments?","Ensures knowledge sharing, enables team collaboration, supports maintenance, aids troubleshooting, and meets compliance requirements."
"What are the key elements of Infrastructure as Code?","Version control, reproducible deployments, automated provisioning, consistent environments, and declarative configuration."
"What is the difference between imperative and declarative infrastructure management?","Imperative specifies HOW to achieve a state (step-by-step), while declarative specifies WHAT the desired state should be."
"Why should container images be kept minimal?","Reduces attack surface, decreases image size, improves startup time, reduces resource usage, and simplifies security scanning."
"What is the purpose of multi-stage builds in Docker?","Reduces final image size by separating build dependencies from runtime requirements, improving security and performance."
"What does 'fail fast' principle mean in containerized applications?","Applications should detect problems early and exit quickly rather than continuing in a degraded state, enabling rapid recovery."
"What is the purpose of container orchestration?","Automates deployment, scaling, networking, and management of containerized applications across multiple hosts."
"What are the advantages of using Docker Compose for local development?","Simplifies multi-container applications, ensures consistent environments, enables easy service management, and supports rapid iteration."
"What is the difference between development, staging, and production environments?","Development for active coding, staging for testing with production-like data, production for live user-facing applications with highest security/stability."
"Why should secrets not be stored in Docker images?","Images can be inspected by anyone with access, secrets in images are immutable, and they violate security best practices for credential management."
"What is the purpose of health checks in production environments?","Enable automated recovery, support load balancing decisions, provide monitoring data, and ensure service availability."
"What does 'immutable infrastructure' mean?","Infrastructure components are replaced rather than modified, ensuring consistency and reducing configuration drift."
"What is the importance of log aggregation in containerized environments?","Centralizes logs from multiple containers, enables correlation analysis, supports compliance requirements, and simplifies troubleshooting."
"What are the benefits of using official base images?","Security updates, maintenance support, documentation, community trust, and adherence to best practices."
"What is container image vulnerability scanning?","Automated process to identify known security vulnerabilities in container images and their dependencies."
"Why is resource monitoring important in containerized environments?","Prevents resource starvation, enables capacity planning, supports performance optimization, and ensures fair resource sharing."
"What is the purpose of network segmentation in container environments?","Limits blast radius of security breaches, controls traffic flow, enables policy enforcement, and improves overall security posture."
"What does 'shift left' mean in DevSecOps?","Moving security considerations earlier in the development lifecycle, addressing issues during development rather than deployment."
"What are the key principles of the twelve-factor app methodology?","Codebase, dependencies, config, backing services, build/release/run, processes, port binding, concurrency, disposability, dev/prod parity, logs, admin processes."
