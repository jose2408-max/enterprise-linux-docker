Front,Back
"What are the key security principles when running containers?","Run as non-root user, use minimal base images, limit network exposure, implement proper access controls, and regularly update images."
"What is a health check in Docker and why is it important?","A health check is a command that Docker runs periodically to check if a container is working properly. It helps with automated recovery and monitoring."
"What is the syntax for a HEALTHCHECK instruction in a Dockerfile?","HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --retries=3 CMD command"
"What do the HEALTHCHECK parameters mean?","--interval: time between checks, --timeout: max time for check to complete, --retries: consecutive failures before marking unhealthy, --start-period: grace period"
"What does 'docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' container' show?","Shows the current health status of a container: starting, healthy, unhealthy, or none."
"What is Portainer and why is it useful?","Portainer is a web-based Docker management interface that provides a GUI for managing containers, images, networks, and volumes."
"What port does Portainer CE run on by default?","Port 9000"
"Why do we map /var/run/docker.sock into the Portainer container?","It gives Portainer access to the Docker daemon so it can manage Docker resources on the host system."
"What does the logging configuration in Docker Compose control?","Controls how container logs are stored, rotated, and managed, including driver type, max file size, and number of files."
"What does 'max-size: \"10m\"' and 'max-file: \"3\"' mean in logging config?","Limits each log file to 10MB maximum and keeps only 3 log files, automatically rotating when limits are reached."
"What is the json-file logging driver?","The default Docker logging driver that writes logs in JSON format to files on the host filesystem."
"What command shows real-time resource usage of all running containers?","docker stats"
"What does 'docker stats --no-stream' do?","Shows resource usage statistics once without continuous streaming updates."
"What is the purpose of container resource limits?","Prevents containers from consuming excessive CPU, memory, or other resources, ensuring system stability and fair resource sharing."
"What does network isolation provide in containerized environments?","Network isolation prevents unauthorized communication between containers and limits attack surface by controlling network access."
"Why is it important to use specific image tags instead of 'latest'?","Specific tags ensure reproducible builds and prevent unexpected changes when the 'latest' tag is updated with new versions."
"What is the principle of least privilege in container security?","Give containers and users only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their functions, reducing potential attack impact."
"What does 'USER appuser' do in a Dockerfile?","Switches the user context to 'appuser' for subsequent instructions and when the container runs, avoiding root execution."
"What is the purpose of the LABEL instruction in Dockerfiles?","Adds metadata to images for documentation, automation, organization, and management purposes."
"What information should enterprise container labels include?","Maintainer, version, description, vendor, release date, security scan status, and compliance level."
"What does 'restart: unless-stopped' policy prevent?","Prevents containers from automatically restarting if they were manually stopped by an administrator."
"Why do we create separate volumes for logs, config, and shared data?","Separation improves security, allows independent backup strategies, and enables different access controls for different data types."
"What is the purpose of the shared data volume in our setup?","Allows secure file sharing between containers while maintaining isolation from the host filesystem."
"What does 'docker volume ls --filter label=com.company.volume' do?","Lists only volumes that have the specified label, helping organize and manage enterprise volumes."
"How do you monitor Docker container health from the command line?","Use 'docker ps' to see basic status, 'docker inspect' for detailed health info, and custom monitoring scripts for comprehensive checks."
