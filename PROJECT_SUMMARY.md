## 🏆 What We Built

### Multi-Distribution Environment
- ✅ **RHEL UBI 9**: Production-ready Red Hat container
- ✅ **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**: Development and CI/CD ready
- ✅ **CentOS 7**: Legacy application support
- ✅ **Portainer CE**: Web-based container management

### Enterprise Security Features
- ✅ Non-root user execution (`appuser`)
- ✅ Custom bridge network isolation (172.20.0.0/16)
- ✅ Minimal attack surface with essential packages only
- ✅ Proper file permissions (750) for application directories
- ✅ Limited sudo privileges for specific commands

### Production-Ready Operations
- ✅ Health checks for all containers
- ✅ Centralized logging with rotation (10MB max, 3 files)
- ✅ Persistent volumes with proper labeling
- ✅ Restart policies for high availability
- ✅ Custom monitoring script with colored output
- ✅ Resource usage tracking

### Infrastructure as Code
- ✅ Reproducible deployments via Docker Compose
- ✅ Version-controlled configuration
- ✅ Consistent labeling strategy
- ✅ Environment variable management
- ✅ Scalable architecture

## 📊 Current Environment Status

**Containers Running:**
- `rhel-prod-server` (172.20.0.4) - ✅ Healthy
- `ubuntu-prod-server` (172.20.0.5) - ✅ Healthy  
- `centos-legacy-server` (172.20.0.2) - ✅ Running
- `portainer-management` (172.20.0.3:9000) - ✅ Running

**Volumes Created:**
- 7 persistent volumes with enterprise labeling
- Shared data volume for inter-container communication
- Separate log and config volumes per service

**Network:**
- Custom `enterprise-net` bridge network
- Isolated subnet with proper gateway configuration
- Container-to-container communication enabled

## 🚀 Quick Access Commands

```bash
# Check environment status
./scripts/monitor.sh

# Access Portainer web interface
open http://localhost:9000

# Execute commands in containers
docker exec -it rhel-prod-server bash
docker exec -it ubuntu-prod-server bash

# View logs
docker-compose logs rhel-enterprise
docker-compose logs ubuntu-enterprise

# Restart environment
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```
